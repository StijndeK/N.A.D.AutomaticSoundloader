# EXP2
The second VASD prototype. EXP2 builds further on EXP1. Added features are vertical layering, audiotails playing and using folders to name more efficiently.

## Example
Applied to Project Rookery:

[v2](https://streamable.com/cstiw8)

## Instructions
Create a folder for every layer in the layers folder and bounce audio into the folders.

### File naming
- End the title of a folder with the number of the current layer
- Start the file name with the number of the loop (1 to 9) and end with '_'
- Type any information or name you like and again end with '_'
- End the file name with the numbers of the audio track that the loop can transition to

For example:
layer1/1_NameAndOtherInformation_124.wav
is the first track on the first layer and can loop or transition to track 2 or 4
