# N.A.D. Automatic Sound Loader
ASL is a terminal application that allows the user to quickly test a horizontal nonlinear system, by automatically loading and parsing files based on given filenames. Export audio directly into a folder names and it will automatically be sequenced based on the given possibilities.

## N.A.D.
ASL is the first experiment for my thesis about: Tools for Designing Nonlinear Audio for Games. As a game audio designer I am hindered during my creative process, due to the discrepancy between the nonlinearity of my work and the linear character of standard audio production software. Standard linear audio production tools offer little to none nonlinear sequencing, transitioning, parameter adaption and probability functionalities. Furthermore, linear sequencers are not optimised to provide a visual representation of nonlinear systems. Existing standard middleware solutions focus less on tackling the obstructions in the design stage of a project. These issues cause testing and prototyping to take unnecessary amounts of time and obscures communication with collaborators. This obstructs the workflow and discourages innovation.

## Current status and improvements
This project tackles the issue of the amount of time and disturbance in workflow caused by the time it takes from creating audio to being able to hear and test it in its nonlinear system. Quick testing by obtaining information from filenames, saves time and tackles the disruption in workflow. As a test to see if this type of system could work, the project has succeeded. However, the functionalities are still very limited and file names do need to be named very specifically. Furthermore it can't be used to test adaptive systems, as there is no parameter adaption implmented. Improvements such as parameter adaption and visualisation are tackled in [N.A.D Procedural Audio System](https://github.com/StijndeK/N.A.D.ProceduralAudioSystem) and [N.A.D Visual Parameter Adaption in Unity](https://github.com/StijndeK/N.A.D.VisualParameterAdaption).
