# N.A.D. Automatic Sound Loader
ASL is a prototype terminal application that allows the user to quickly test a horizontal nonlinear system. Export audio directly into the folder with specific file names and they will automatically be sequenced based on the given possibilities. 

## Application to context
[This video](https://streamable.com/reu4v) shows this experiment demonstrated on a early musical concept for Rookery, a game currently being developed.

## NADT
Procedural Audio System (working title) is the third experiment in a range of experiments meant to adress obstructions in the process of designing and prototyping nonlinear audiosystems. [Click here](http://sdkoning.com/PF/N.A.D.T..html) for more information on the project.

## Current status and improvements
This project tackles the issue of the amount of time and disturbance in workflow caused by the time it takes from creating audio to being able to hear and test it in its nonlinear system. Quick testing by directly bouncing the audio with specific names, saves time and tackles the disruption in workflow. As a test to find out if this type of system could work, the project has succeeded. However, the functionalities are still very limited and file names do need to be named very specifically. Improvements such as parameter adaption and visualisation are tackled in [N.A.D Procedural Audio System](https://github.com/StijndeK/N.A.D.ProceduralAudioSystem) and [N.A.D Visual Parameter Adaption in Unity](https://github.com/StijndeK/N.A.D.VisualParameterAdaption).
