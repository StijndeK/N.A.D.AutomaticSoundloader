# N.A.D. Automatic Sound Loader
ASL is a terminal application that allows the user to quickly test a horizontal nonlinear system that doesn't require any input (doesn't adapt to game parameters). Export audio directly into the folder with specific file names and they will automatically be sequenced based on the given possibilities.

## Application to context
The automatic sound loader experiments have been applied to Rookery. A walking simulator type game.

## N.A.D.
ASL is the first experiment for my thesis about: Tools for Designing Nonlinear Audio for Games. As a game audio designer I am hindered during my creative process, due to the discrepancy between the nonlinearity of my work and the linear character of standard audio production software. Standard linear audio production tools offer little to none nonlinear sequencing, transitioning, parameter adaption and probability functionalities. Furthermore, linear sequencers are not optimised to provide a visual representation of nonlinear systems. Existing standard middleware solutions focus less on tackling the obstructions in the design stage of a project. These issues cause testing and prototyping to take unnecessary amounts of time and obscures communication with collaborators. This obstructs the workflow and discourages innovation.

## Current status and improvements
This project tackles the issue of the amount of time and disturbance in workflow caused by the time it takes from creating audio to being able to hear and test it in its nonlinear system. Quick testing by directly bouncing the audio with specific names, saves time and tackles the disruption in workflow. As a test to see if this type of system could work, the project has succeeded. However, the functionalities are still very limited and file names do need to be named very specifically. Improvements such as parameter adaption and visualisation are tackled in [N.A.D Procedural Audio System](https://github.com/StijndeK/N.A.D.ProceduralAudioSystem) and [N.A.D Visual Parameter Adaption in Unity](https://github.com/StijndeK/N.A.D.VisualParameterAdaption).
